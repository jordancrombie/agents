## 🔴 Token Response Mismatch (NEW - 2026-01-26)

### The Issue

When a user approves a guest checkout via the device code flow, WSIM's `/api/agent/v1/oauth/token` endpoint returns **agent credentials** instead of an **access token**.

**WSIM returns** (when status is 'approved'):
```json
{
  "client_id": "agent_xyz",
  "client_secret": "secret_abc",
  "token_endpoint": "https://wsim.banksim.ca/api/agent/v1/oauth/token",
  "permissions": ["payment:initiate"],
  "spending_limits": { ... }
}
```

**Gateway expects** (per RFC 8628 Section 3.5):
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

### Why This Happens

WSIM's device code flow was designed for **agent onboarding** - giving agents credentials they can use repeatedly for multiple transactions. But guest checkout needs **immediate payment authorization** - a one-time access token to complete this specific transaction.

### Location in Code

`agent-oauth.ts:1556-1567` - the `case 'approved':` branch returns credentials, not a token.

### Agreed Solution: Option A - `response_type` parameter (2026-01-26)

**Decision:** WSIM will add a `response_type` parameter to the device_authorization endpoint.

| `response_type` | Behavior | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| `credentials` (default) | Returns `client_id` + `client_secret` | Agent onboarding (persistent) |
| `token` | Returns `access_token` directly | Guest checkout (one-time) |

**Gateway Request:**
```json
POST /api/agent/v1/oauth/device_authorization
{
  "agent_name": "SACP Gateway Checkout",
  "scope": "purchase",
  "spending_limits": { "per_transaction": "21.46", ... },
  "response_type": "token"  // NEW
}
```

**Token Response (after user approval):**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "scope": "purchase"
}
```

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ RFC 8628 compliant for guest checkout
- ✅ Backwards compatible (defaults to `credentials`)
- ✅ Explicit intent - no magic heuristics
- ✅ Minimal Gateway change (add one parameter)
- ✅ One-shot tokens can't be reused (better security)

**Implementation Status:**
| Team | Task | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| WSIM | Add `responseType` field to AccessRequest schema | ✅ DONE (v1.2.4) |
| WSIM | Accept `response_type` param in device_authorization | ✅ DONE (v1.2.4) |
| WSIM | Return access_token when `responseType === 'token'` | ✅ DONE (v1.2.4) |
| Gateway | Add `response_type: 'token'` to device_authorization call | ✅ DONE |

## Executive Summary

This document proposes changes to the SACP Gateway to support a "guest checkout" flow that mirrors standard e-commerce patterns. Currently, the Gateway requires OAuth authentication before users can create a checkout session. This proposal moves authentication to **payment time only**, allowing users to browse and build carts without upfront authorization.

---

## Architectural Decision: Option A Confirmed (2026-01-25)

### Decision

**Option A: SSIM makes guest checkout session endpoints unauthenticated.**

The `security: []` specification in the OpenAPI spec was **deliberate and correct**. Guest checkout semantically means unauthenticated checkout - a "guest" by definition doesn't have credentials.

### Why Option B (Service Tokens) Was Rejected

The Agents team initially implemented a workaround using Gateway service tokens (`getGatewayServiceToken()`) to authenticate with SSIM. This approach was **incorrect** for the following reasons:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Data model violation** | The Agent schema has `userId` as a required FK to a real `WalletUser`. Creating fake users or returning synthetic IDs for service accounts pollutes this relationship. Every query like "show me agents for user X" becomes unreliable. |
| **Technical debt** | This workaround causes confusion when someone asks "why does this agent have `owner_id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`?" |
| **Conflates auth models** | Service-to-service auth is fundamentally different from user-delegated auth. Option B conflates them. |
| **Wrong trust boundary** | The proper trust boundary is: unauthenticated session creation → authenticated payment completion (via Device Auth). |

### Why Option A Is Correct

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Aligns with design intent** | The design doc was reviewed by multiple teams. `security: []` was deliberate. |
| **Clean separation** | Browse/cart is unauthenticated; payment completion requires Device Authorization. This is the proper trust boundary. |
| **SSIM controls scope** | SSIM can make just the guest checkout session endpoints unauthenticated while keeping other routes protected. |
| **No data model hacks** | No synthetic `owner_id`, no service account workarounds, no confusion. |

### Naming Lesson Learned

Calling it "Gateway" probably contributed to confusion. "Gateway" sounds like infrastructure that would use service-to-service auth. A better name might have been "Guest Checkout Service" to make the unauthenticated nature explicit.

### Required Changes

| Team | Change Required |
|------|-----------------|
| **SSIM** | Make guest checkout session endpoints unauthenticated (`POST /sessions`, `PATCH /sessions/:id`, `GET /sessions/:id`) |
| **Gateway** | Remove `getGatewayServiceToken()` workaround once SSIM change is deployed |
| **WSIM** | None - Device Authorization already works as designed |

### Current State

The Gateway currently uses a service token workaround (`getGatewayServiceToken()`) which authenticates to SSIM using client credentials. **This is a temporary workaround** and should be removed once SSIM implements Option A.

## Problem Statement

### Current Flow (Gateway v1.3.x)
```
1. User asks AI to shop           → AI calls GET /products (no auth) ✓
2. User wants to add to cart      → AI calls POST /checkout
                                    → BLOCKED: Requires OAuth token ✗
3. User must authenticate first   → OAuth redirect to WSIM
4. After auth, checkout proceeds  → Flow continues
```

**Issues:**
1. **Unnatural UX**: Real e-commerce sites don't require login to browse or add to cart
2. **ChatGPT friction**: ChatGPT's OAuth Actions require upfront authentication before ANY protected endpoint
3. **Conceptual confusion**: We're conflating store authentication (optional) with wallet authorization (required for payment)

### Desired Flow (Guest Checkout)
```
1. User asks AI to shop           → AI calls GET /products (no auth) ✓
2. User wants to add to cart      → AI calls POST /checkout (no auth) ✓
3. User provides buyer info       → AI calls PATCH /checkout/:id (no auth) ✓
4. User completes purchase        → AI calls POST /checkout/:id/complete
                                    → Returns: authorization_required + auth_url
5. User authorizes payment        → Clicks link / scans QR / approves in wallet app
6. AI polls for completion        → GET /checkout/:id/payment-status/:request_id
7. Order confirmed                → AI displays confirmation
```

```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Gateway Service Account**: The Gateway operates as a pre-registered agent (`sacp-gateway`) with WSIM/SSIM, allowing it to create checkouts on behalf of users without per-user OAuth.

2. **Payment-Time Authorization**: When `POST /checkout/:id/complete` is called without a user token, the Gateway initiates WSIM Device Authorization flow and returns the auth URL/QR code for the user.

3. **Polling Model**: The AI polls a new endpoint to detect when the user has approved payment in their wallet app.

## SSIM Team Analysis (2026-01-25)

### ⚠️ SUPERSEDED - See "Architectural Decision: Option A Confirmed" above

~~The SSIM team has reviewed this proposal and **confirmed Option A (Gateway has its own agent credentials)** is the correct approach.~~

**This analysis was incorrect.** Senior developers clarified that:

1. **Option A actually means**: SSIM makes guest checkout endpoints unauthenticated (`security: []`)
2. **NOT**: Gateway uses service tokens to authenticate

The table below reflects the **original (incorrect) analysis** and is preserved for historical context only.

| Criteria | ~~Option A: Gateway Credentials~~ | Option B: Anonymous Checkout |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ~~Security Model~~ | ~~✅ Maintains authenticated actor principle~~ | ~~❌ Creates anonymous attack surface~~ |
| ~~SACP Philosophy~~ | ~~✅ Gateway is a first-class agent~~ | ~~❌ Violates agent identity model~~ |
| ~~Multi-tenant Safety~~ | ~~✅ Credentials scoped by storeId~~ | ~~❌ Requires additional abuse prevention~~ |
| ~~Audit Trail~~ | ~~✅ Every action tied to agent identity~~ | ~~❌ No attribution for session creation~~ |
| ~~Future Extensibility~~ | ~~✅ Pattern scales to more agents~~ | ~~❌ Sets bad precedent~~ |
| ~~SSIM Changes~~ | ~~✅ None required~~ | ~~❌ Invasive changes needed~~ |

**Correct Understanding (2026-01-25):**

| Criteria | Option A: SSIM Unauthenticated Sessions | Option B: Service Token Workaround |
|----------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Design Intent | ✅ Matches original `security: []` spec | ❌ Workaround for implementation divergence |
| Data Model | ✅ Clean - no synthetic owner_ids | ❌ Violates Agent schema relationships |
| Trust Boundary | ✅ Proper: unauth cart → auth payment | ❌ Conflates service auth with user auth |
| Technical Debt | ✅ None | ❌ Confusing synthetic IDs |
| SSIM Changes | ⚠️ Required (make endpoints unauth) | ❌ None, but wrong approach |

### Token Introspection Architecture (RFC 7662)

SSIM uses token introspection - the industry-standard approach for financial APIs:

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Gateway   │         │    SSIM     │         │    WSIM     │
└──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘
       │                       │                       │
       │ 1. Bearer <jwt>       │                       │
       │──────────────────────>│                       │
       │                       │ 2. Introspect token   │
       │                       │──────────────────────>│
       │                       │ 3. { active: true,    │
       │                       │      agent_id, perms }│
       │                       │<──────────────────────│
       │ 4. Response           │                       │
       │<──────────────────────│                       │
```

**Why Introspection (not direct JWT validation)?**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Introspection (SSIM uses this) | Real-time revocation, live spending limits, single source of truth | Extra network hop |
| Direct JWT | Faster (no network call) | Stale data, can't revoke until expiry |

For financial transactions, introspection is correct. SSIM's 60s TTL cache balances performance with freshness.

### Current State: What's Already Implemented

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Agent token validation middleware | ✅ Done | ssim/src/services/wsim-agent.ts |
| Token caching (60s TTL) | ✅ Done | ssim/src/services/wsim-agent.ts |
| Introspection client config | ✅ Done | ssim/src/config/env.ts |
| Agent API routes | ✅ Done | ssim/src/routes/agent.ts |
| NSIM accepts agentContext | ✅ Done (v1.2.0) | NSIM payment API |

### Identified Gap: Agent Context in Payment Flow

The full agent payment flow should be:

```
Gateway → SSIM → WSIM (introspect) ✅ Working
               → NSIM (authorize with agentContext) ⚠️ Needs verification
```

**Gap:** When a request originates from an authenticated agent session, does SSIM's payment service pass `agentContext` to NSIM?

- NSIM v1.2.0 now accepts `agentContext` for agent-initiated payments
- SSIM validates the agent token via WSIM introspection
- **Action needed:** Verify SSIM includes agent context when calling NSIM's payment API

This is likely a small code enhancement if not already present - passing the agent metadata through to NSIM.

### Address/Fulfillment Data Handling

**Clarification (2026-01-25):** SSIM currently accepts `fulfillment.address` data in checkout sessions but **does not** pass this to the payment network (NSIM/BSIM) as part of the transaction. The address is stored with the order for merchant reference only.

| Data Field | Accepted | Stored | Passed to NSIM |
|------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| `buyer.name` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `buyer.email` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `fulfillment.address` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `fulfillment.type` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

**If required:** SSIM can be updated to pass address data to NSIM for:
- Address Verification System (AVS) checks
- Fraud prevention transaction details
- Compliance/audit requirements

This would be a small enhancement. Please confirm if this is a requirement for v1.4.0.

### Bottom Line

The infrastructure exists. This sprint is about:

1. **Configuration**: Registering Gateway credentials with WSIM
2. **Verification**: Ensuring agentContext flows through SSIM → NSIM payment calls

No new foundations needed - just wiring the existing pieces together.

## API Changes

### Endpoints with Security Changes

| Endpoint | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `GET /products` | No auth | No auth | No change |
| `POST /checkout` | OAuth required | **No auth** | Creates session only |
| `PATCH /checkout/:id` | OAuth required | **No auth** | Updates buyer info only |
| `GET /checkout/:id` | OAuth required | **No auth** | View cart/status |
| `POST /checkout/:id/complete` | OAuth required | **No auth*** | *Returns auth URL if no token |
| `GET /checkout/:id/payment-status/:id` | N/A | **New endpoint** | Poll for payment approval |
| `GET /orders/:id` | OAuth required | OAuth required | Order history requires auth |

### New Endpoint: Payment Status Polling

```
GET /checkout/{session_id}/payment-status/{request_id}

Response (pending):
{
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "Waiting for payment authorization...",
  "expires_in": 850
}

Response (approved):
{
  "status": "completed",
  "order_id": "ord_abc123",
  "transaction_id": "txn_xyz789",
  "message": "Payment approved! Order confirmed."
}

Response (rejected/expired):
{
  "status": "rejected" | "expired",
  "message": "Payment was rejected by user" | "Authorization request expired"
}
```

### Modified Endpoint: Complete Checkout

```
POST /checkout/{session_id}/complete

# If user has Bearer token (from prior OAuth):
→ Proceeds with payment using token
→ Returns order confirmation or step_up_required

# If NO Bearer token:
Response (202 Accepted):
{
  "status": "authorization_required",
  "authorization_url": "https://wsim.banksim.ca/api/agent/v1/oauth/authorize?...",
  "qr_code_url": "https://wsim.banksim.ca/m/device?code=WSIM-A3J2K9",
  "user_code": "WSIM-A3J2K9",
  "verification_uri": "https://wsim.banksim.ca/m/device",
  "poll_endpoint": "/checkout/{session_id}/payment-status/{request_id}",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "message": "Please authorize the payment by clicking the link or entering code WSIM-A3J2K9 in your wallet app."
}
```

---

## OpenAPI Specification Changes

```yaml
# Remove security from these endpoints:
/checkout:
  post:
    security: []  # Was: [{ oauth2: ['shopping'] }]

/checkout/{session_id}:
  patch:
    security: []  # Was: [{ oauth2: ['shopping'] }]
  get:
    security: []  # Was: [{ oauth2: ['shopping'] }]

/checkout/{session_id}/complete:
  post:
    security: []  # No upfront auth; returns auth_url if needed
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Payment completed (user already authorized)
      '202':
        description: Authorization required
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/AuthorizationRequired'

# New endpoint:
/checkout/{session_id}/payment-status/{request_id}:
  get:
    security: []
    summary: Poll for payment authorization status
    responses:
      '200':
        description: Current authorization status
```

## Implementation Details

### Gateway Configuration

New environment variables required:

```env
# Gateway's own agent credentials (registered with WSIM)
GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID=sacp-gateway
GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>

# Used for talking to SSIM on behalf of anonymous users
GATEWAY_SSIM_TOKEN=<service-token>
```

### Checkout Session Storage

Extend session storage to track payment authorization requests:

```typescript
interface CheckoutSession {
  id: string;
  ssim_session_id: string;  // SSIM checkout session
  items: CartItem[];
  buyer?: BuyerInfo;
  fulfillment?: FulfillmentInfo;
  status: 'cart' | 'ready_for_payment' | 'authorizing' | 'completed';

  // Payment authorization tracking (new)
  payment_request_id?: string;  // WSIM device_code / request_id
  payment_user_code?: string;   // WSIM-XXXXXX (shortened per RFC 8628)
  payment_expires_at?: Date;
  user_access_token?: string;   // After authorization approved
}
```

### Complete Checkout Flow (Pseudocode)

```typescript
app.post('/checkout/:session_id/complete', async (req, res) => {
  const session = getCheckoutSession(req.params.session_id);

  // Check if user already has auth token
  const userToken = extractBearerToken(req);

  if (userToken) {
    // User is authenticated - proceed with payment
    const paymentToken = await wsim.requestPaymentToken(userToken, session);
    const order = await ssim.completeCheckout(session, paymentToken);
    return res.json({ status: 'completed', order_id: order.id });
  }

  // No auth token - initiate device authorization
  const deviceAuth = await wsim.startDeviceAuthorization({
    scope: 'purchase',
    agent_name: 'SACP Gateway',
    spending_limits: {
      per_transaction: session.cart.total,
      currency: session.cart.currency
    }
  });

  // Store the authorization request
  session.payment_request_id = deviceAuth.device_code;
  session.payment_user_code = deviceAuth.user_code;
  session.payment_expires_at = new Date(Date.now() + deviceAuth.expires_in * 1000);
  session.status = 'authorizing';

  return res.status(202).json({
    status: 'authorization_required',
    authorization_url: buildAuthUrl(deviceAuth),
    qr_code_url: deviceAuth.verification_uri_complete,
    user_code: deviceAuth.user_code,
    verification_uri: deviceAuth.verification_uri,
    poll_endpoint: `/checkout/${session.id}/payment-status/${deviceAuth.device_code}`,
    expires_in: deviceAuth.expires_in,
    message: `Please authorize the payment by clicking the link or entering code ${deviceAuth.user_code} in your wallet app.`
  });
});
```

2. **User Codes**: Shortened from `WSIM-XXXXXX-XXXXXX` (18 chars) to `WSIM-XXXXXX` (11 chars) per RFC 8628 Section 6.1
3. **Environment Variable**: `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_SACP_GATEWAY`

**Credentials for Agents Team:**
```
GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID=sacp-gateway
GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET=<provided-via-secure-channel>
```
⚠️ **Note**: Secrets are provided via secure channel (not stored in repo). Contact WSIM team for credentials.

### SSIM - Owner: SSIM Team

| Task | Effort | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **CHANGE REQUIRED**: Make guest checkout session endpoints unauthenticated | Medium | ✅ DONE (v2.2.5) |
| **Review**: Option A (unauthenticated sessions) confirmed | Review | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| **Verify**: Ensure `agentContext` passed to NSIM in payment calls | Code Review | ✅ VERIFIED |

**Architecture Decision (2026-01-25):**

**Option A Confirmed**: SSIM should make guest checkout session endpoints **unauthenticated** (`security: []`).

The `security: []` in the OpenAPI spec was deliberate - guest checkout means unauthenticated checkout. The Gateway's service token workaround was incorrect and will be removed.

**SSIM Changes Required:**

| Endpoint | Current | Required | Notes |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| `POST /api/agent/v1/sessions` | Auth required | **No auth** | Creates cart only |
| `PATCH /api/agent/v1/sessions/:id` | Auth required | **No auth** | Updates buyer info only |
| `GET /api/agent/v1/sessions/:id` | Auth required | **No auth** | View cart/status |
| `POST /api/agent/v1/sessions/:id/complete` | Auth required | Auth required | Payment requires Device Auth token |

**Rationale**: Guest checkout follows standard e-commerce patterns where:
- Browse, add to cart, provide shipping info → No authentication
- Pay → Authentication required (Device Authorization at payment time)

**SSIM Verification (2026-01-25):**

`agentContext` is **already implemented** and passed to NSIM. The agentContext code is correct and needs no changes.

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| `AgentContext` interface | ✅ Defined | [payment.ts:7-13](ssim/src/services/payment.ts#L7-L13) |
| `AuthorizeParams.agentContext` | ✅ Defined | [payment.ts:22](ssim/src/services/payment.ts#L22) |
| Payment service → NSIM | ✅ Sends agentContext | [payment.ts:119-123](ssim/src/services/payment.ts#L119-L123) |
| Agent API builds context | ✅ From session | [agent-api.ts:1049-1056](ssim/src/routes/agent-api.ts#L1049-L1056) |
| Agent API → authorizePayment | ✅ Passes context | [agent-api.ts:1123](ssim/src/routes/agent-api.ts#L1123) |

**Data passed to NSIM:**
```typescript
agentContext: {
  agentId: session.agentId,      // Gateway's agent ID
  ownerId: session.ownerId,      // User who approved payment
  humanPresent: false,           // Agent-initiated
  mandateId: string | undefined, // If using mandate
  mandateType: 'cart'            // Transaction type
}
```

| **Review**: ~~Confirm push notification flow works for device auth~~ | Review | ✅ CLARIFIED |
| **New**: Ensure "Enter Code" screen accessible for Device Authorization | Low | ✅ DONE |

**mwsim v2.2.0 Analysis (2026-01-25):**

**Important Clarification:** Device Authorization (RFC 8628) does **NOT** use push notifications. This is a different flow from the Authorization Code flow. See Question #6 answer for details.

| Feature | mwsim Support | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Device Code Entry Screen | ✅ **Implemented** | Settings → "Link Device" screen for manual code entry |
| Display client name | ✅ Available | `client_name` field from WSIM |
| Show requested scopes | ✅ Available | Scopes with descriptions |
| Biometric-protected approval | ✅ Available | Face ID/Touch ID required |
| Countdown timer | ✅ Available | 15-minute expiration (per RFC 8628) |
| Reject option | ✅ Available | Available without biometric |
| Spending limits display | ✅ Available | Shows per-transaction, daily, monthly limits |

**mwsim Implementation (Updated 2026-01-25):**

**Screen: DeviceCodeEntryScreen** (Settings → "Link Device")

| Feature | Requirement | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Code input | Accept `WSIM-XXXXXX` or `XXXXXX` (case insensitive) | ✅ Done |
| Agent name | Display `agent_name` from claim response | ✅ Done |
| Permissions list | Show `requested_permissions` with descriptions | ✅ Done |
| Spending limits | Show per-transaction, daily, monthly limits | ✅ Done |
| Countdown timer | Show `time_remaining_seconds` with live countdown | ✅ Done |
| Approve button | Requires biometric auth, calls approve endpoint | ✅ Done |
| Reject button | No biometric required, calls reject endpoint | ✅ Done |

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/src/screens/DeviceCodeEntry.tsx` - New screen
- `app/src/types/agent.ts` - Added `DeviceCodeClaimRequest`, `DeviceCodeClaimResponse`
- `app/src/services/agent-api.ts` - Added `claimDeviceCode()` method
- `app/src/screens/Settings.tsx` - Added "Link Device" option
- `app/App.tsx` - Added `deviceCodeEntry` screen routing

**⚠️ API Correction - Actual WSIM Endpoints:**

```typescript
// 1. Claim/lookup device code (NOT a GET - it's a POST)
POST /api/mobile/device-codes/claim
Body: { user_code: "WSIM-A3J2K9" }  // or just "A3J2K9"
Response: {
  access_request: {
    id: "req_xxx",
    agent_name: "SACP Gateway Checkout",
    agent_description: "...",
    requested_permissions: ["browse", "cart", "purchase"],
    requested_limits: {
      per_transaction: "21.46",
      daily: "21.46",
      monthly: "21.46",
      currency: "CAD"
    },
    expires_at: "2026-01-25T12:15:00Z",
    time_remaining_seconds: 850
  }
}

// 2. Approve (requires biometric)
POST /api/mobile/access-requests/:requestId/approve
Body: { consent: true }

// 3. Reject
POST /api/mobile/access-requests/:requestId/reject
Body: { reason?: "User declined" }
```

**User Flow:**
1. User navigates to Settings → Link Device
2. User enters code shown by ChatGPT (e.g., `WSIM-A3J2K9`)
3. mwsim calls `POST /device-codes/claim` → returns access request details
4. User reviews agent name, permissions, and spending limits
5. User approves (biometric) or rejects
6. Gateway's polling detects approval → checkout completes

## Questions for Teams

### For WSIM Team (Priority)

1. **Agent Registration**: What's the process to register `sacp-gateway` as a new agent? (API, admin UI, or DB seed?)

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** Three options available:

   | Method | Use Case | Process |
   |--------|----------|---------|
   | **DB Seed** (Recommended for Gateway) | Pre-registered service accounts | Add to database migration or seed script |
   | Mobile API | User-registered agents | `POST /api/mobile/agents` via mwsim |
   | Device Authorization | Agent-initiated with user approval | `POST /device_authorization` + user enters code |

   **For `sacp-gateway`:** Use DB seed or add to `KNOWN_OAUTH_CLIENTS` in [agent-oauth.ts](backend/src/routes/agent-oauth.ts:193) similar to how `chatgpt`, `claude-mcp`, and `gemini` are pre-registered. This gives the Gateway a known `client_id` and configured `client_secret` via environment variable (`OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_SACP_GATEWAY`).

2. **Permission Scoping**: Can `sacp-gateway` credentials be scoped to specific permissions? (e.g., `checkout:create` only, no `payment:execute`)

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** Yes. Valid permissions are: `browse`, `cart`, `purchase`, `history`.

   | Permission | Description | Gateway Needs? |
   |------------|-------------|----------------|
   | `browse` | View products/catalog | ✅ Yes |
   | `cart` | Create/manage carts | ✅ Yes |
   | `purchase` | Execute payments | ✅ Yes |
   | `history` | View transaction history | ❌ No |

   **Note:** There's no separate `checkout:create` vs `payment:execute` split. The `purchase` permission allows payment token requests. For Gateway guest checkout, the user approves each transaction via Device Authorization, so permissions are scoped to that single session.

3. **Production Config**: Is `ssim-merchant` already configured in production's `INTROSPECTION_CLIENTS`?

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** Check your production environment. The `INTROSPECTION_CLIENTS` env var accepts a JSON array:

   ```json
   [{"clientId":"ssim-merchant","clientSecret":"<secret>"},{"clientId":"sacp-gateway","clientSecret":"<secret>"}]
   ```

   Default development fallback: `ssim_introspect` (see [env.ts:53-56](backend/src/config/env.ts#L53-L56))

   **Action Required:** Gateway team should confirm with DevOps that `ssim-merchant` is in production config. If not, add it along with `sacp-gateway`.

4. **Device Authorization**: The `POST /api/agent/v1/oauth/device_authorization` endpoint - can it be called by the gateway agent without a specific user context? We want the Gateway to initiate auth on behalf of anonymous users.

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** ✅ **YES - This is exactly how it works!**

   The endpoint requires **no authentication** - it's designed for this use case. See [agent-oauth.ts:62-169](backend/src/routes/agent-oauth.ts#L62-L169):

   1. Gateway calls `POST /device_authorization` with `agent_name`, `scope`, and `spending_limits`
   2. WSIM returns `device_code` + `user_code` (no user context yet)
   3. User claims the code by entering it in mwsim (this associates the request with a user)
   4. Gateway polls token endpoint until approved
   5. On approval, Gateway receives credentials for that user's session

   **This is RFC 8628 Device Authorization Grant** - the user is anonymous until they claim the code.

5. **Spending Limits**: When the gateway initiates device auth, should we pass the checkout total as the spending limit, or use a higher limit?

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** **Pass the exact checkout total** as `per_transaction` limit.

   ```json
   {
     "agent_name": "SACP Gateway Checkout",
     "scope": "purchase",
     "spending_limits": {
       "per_transaction": 21.46,
       "daily": 21.46,
       "monthly": 21.46,
       "currency": "CAD"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Rationale:**
   - Each guest checkout is a single-use authorization
   - Setting all limits to the checkout total ensures the user approves exactly what they're buying
   - No risk of the credentials being reused for unauthorized purchases
   - User sees the exact amount during approval in mwsim

6. **Notification Type Alignment (from mwsim)**: Will `POST /api/agent/v1/oauth/device_authorization` trigger an `oauth.authorization` push notification to mwsim? mwsim v2.2.0 handles this notification type and routes to the `OAuthAuthorization` approval screen. If device auth uses a different notification type, please confirm so mwsim can add handling.

   **WSIM Answer (2026-01-25):** No, Device Authorization (RFC 8628) does **NOT** send push notifications. This is intentional per the RFC specification - the flow is designed for devices with limited input capabilities where the user is already aware they need to authenticate.

   **How Device Authorization Works:**
   1. Gateway calls `POST /device_authorization` → receives `user_code` + `verification_uri`
   2. AI shows user the code (e.g., `WSIM-A3J2K9`) and/or verification URL
   3. User **manually** opens mwsim and navigates to "Enter Code" screen (or visits `verification_uri_complete`)
   4. User enters the code and approves the request directly in the app
   5. Gateway polls until approval is detected

   **Key Difference from Authorization Code Flow:**
   | Flow | Push Notification | User Action |
   |------|-------------------|-------------|
   | Authorization Code (OAuth 2.0) | ✅ Yes - `oauth.authorization` | User receives push, taps to open approval screen |
   | Device Authorization (RFC 8628) | ❌ No | User manually enters code in app or visits URL |

   **mwsim Impact:** No new notification handling needed. mwsim should ensure there's an "Enter Code" screen accessible from the app (already exists at `/m/device` web endpoint - mobile equivalent needed if not present).

7. **User Code Format (WSIM Suggestion)**: The current user code format `WSIM-XXXXXX-XXXXXX` (18 characters) exceeds RFC 8628 Section 6.1 recommendations. We propose shortening to improve usability:

   | Format | Length | Example | RFC 8628 Compliance |
   |--------|--------|---------|---------------------|
   | Current | 18 chars | `WSIM-A3J2K9-B4X8L2` | ⚠️ Longer than recommended |
   | Proposed | 11 chars | `WSIM-A3J2K9` | ✅ Acceptable |
   | Minimal | 8 chars | `A3J2K9B4` | ✅ Optimal per RFC |

   **RFC 8628 Section 6.1 User Code Recommendations:**
   - Should be ~8 characters for easy entry
   - Case-insensitive (WSIM uses uppercase only ✅)
   - Avoid ambiguous characters like I, O, 0, 1, L (WSIM excludes these ✅)
   - Easy to type on limited input devices

   **WSIM Recommendation:** Shorten to `WSIM-XXXXXX` (11 chars) to retain branding while improving usability. The 6-character random portion (using 32-character alphabet: A-Z excluding I,O + 2-9 excluding 0,1) provides ~1 billion combinations - sufficient for 15-minute validity windows.

### For SSIM Team (Resolved)

~~6. **Checkout Without User Token**: Can the Gateway create checkout sessions using its own service credentials?~~
   - **Answer**: ✅ Yes - Option A confirmed. Gateway acts as a first-class agent with its own credentials.

~~7. **Token Introspection**: Does SSIM introspect Gateway tokens?~~
   - **Answer**: ✅ Yes - SSIM uses RFC 7662 token introspection with WSIM, with 60s TTL cache.

~~8. **Agent Context Flow**: Does SSIM pass `agentContext` to NSIM when processing payments from authenticated agents?~~
   - **Answer**: ✅ Yes - Already implemented. See SSIM Verification section above for code locations.

9. **Address Data in Transactions**: Does the payment flow require address data (AVS, fraud prevention)?
   - **Clarification**: SSIM accepts and stores `fulfillment.address` but does not currently pass it to NSIM. Can add this if required - please confirm.

### For All Teams

10. **Testing**: Can we schedule a cross-team integration test once the Gateway changes are ready?
